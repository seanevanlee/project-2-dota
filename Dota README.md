This is only the MVP for an exciting place where users can share best practices and learn from each other. Currently, the roster is add-as-you-go though an improved version should have all 100+ heroes up as clickable URLs to new hero show pages. In addition, a hero's schema can be further built out such as by adding more enums and booleans for more detail.

Currently, there is a DOTA API which has a generous free version. This would allow this website to stay updated regarding league, team, match, tournament, and player data. For some regular players, it's exciting to learn more about what the pros are doing and how personal performances measures against global averages.

Since this game is built on 5v5 matchups, it would be fun to add a social aspect to this site such as a user selecting on a calendar when the user can play to find someone to complement.

Assuming the average user stays engaged over a long period of time, there is value in the ability to associate many posts with one user for a comment history.

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!
