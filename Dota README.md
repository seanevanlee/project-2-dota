# Technologies Used:

HTML:
This provided a lot of the text you see on the page ranging from anything to the text in the browser's tab to the various forms where you can input data.
CSS:
Like any website, it's better when the site is easier on the eyes. The CSS here helps size images to scale proportionately to the scrolling as well as sets up the website in sections.
JS:
We have to define when approproriate and also add meaningful descriptions for our variables.
EJS:
EJS helps set up the website's routes. From the index, we can go one path deeper into the hero page and another step more to an individual hero's information on the show page.
MongoDB:
This is the database used.
Google OAuth:
Without logging in, the user can't see much on the page and that is thanks to OAuth to keep the privileged information secure.

# Next Steps:

This is only the MVP for an exciting place where users can share best practices and learn from each other. Currently, the roster is add-as-you-go though an improved version should have all 100+ heroes up as clickable URLs to new hero show pages. In addition, a hero's schema can be further built out such as by adding more enums and booleans for more detail.

Currently, there is a DOTA API which has a generous free version. This would allow this website to stay updated regarding league, team, match, tournament, and player data. For some regular players, it's exciting to learn more about what the pros are doing and how personal performances measures against global averages.

Since this game is built on 5v5 matchups, it would be fun to add a social aspect to this site such as a user selecting on a calendar when the user can play to find someone to complement.

Assuming the average user stays engaged over a long period of time, there is value in the ability to associate many posts with one user for a comment history.
